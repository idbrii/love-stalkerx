**STALKER-X** is a camera module for LÃ–VE. It provides basic functionalities that a camera should have and is inspired by 
[hump.camera](http://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/camera.html) and [FlxCamera](http://haxeflixel.com/demos/FlxCamera/). The goal
is to provide enough functions that building something like [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAKwZt3aXQM)
becomes as easy as possible.

# Camera Library Comparison

This repo is a demo that uses the camera in the same world as multiple other camera options:

* [brady](https://github.com/idbrii/love-brady/tree/demo-compare)
* [stalkerx](https://github.com/idbrii/love-stalkerx/tree/demo-compare) (no parallax)
* [gamera+parallax](https://github.com/idbrii/love-parallax/tree/demo)

Using the same demo makes it easier to compare the behaviour and features of the camera libraries.
